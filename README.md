# Performant_Programming
Repository to hold the project for the Performant Programming with Python Class

To initialize the project, run "pip install virtualenv" in a terminal to make sure you have virtualenv install. 

Then, cd into the project's 2nd "ClickerApplication" folder (the one before the ClickerApplication folder with the manage.py file) and run "virtualenv venv" to add the virtual environment, then run "venv/Scripts/activate" to activate the virtual environment

After the venv is up and running, run "pip install Django" to make sure you have django installed in that virtual machine

Now to start the server on your computer you can cd into the "ClickerApplication" folder with the manage.py file (I believe it is the 2nd one) and run "python manage.py runserver" 

Most development will be done in the "Quiz" application, so create views and models here.
